<div>OLAP workloads tend to answer specific business intelligence questions, such as the number of sales of product X over duration Y, which requires values from at most several columns to fulfill this request. Precise access to these needed columns can be granted instantly in column-store systems due to how all record attributes are stored, which increases query performance for these OLAP workloads since less data has to be read and processed. In contrast, row-store systems must retrieve all record attributes and dispose of irrelevant ones (Figure ). This rationale has led to the question whether storing clinical data in columnar DBMSs could increase analytical workload performance.</div>
